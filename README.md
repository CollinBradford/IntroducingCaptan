# IntroducingCaptan
Welcome!  Here we are going to meet the Captan board.  The Captan board was designed by a team of engineers at Fermilab.  It is a hardware set for development of data acquisition systems, or DAQ systems.  There are three development boards in the environment.  The green board, the blue board, and the red board.  Won't that be easy to remember?  RGB.  The green board includes and FPGA, the blue board has an ADC, and the red board is for power stuff.  We don't use the red board in this project.  

The tutorials in this project will take you through setting up the development environment and how to program the board.
